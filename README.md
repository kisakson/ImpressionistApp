# DoodleApp

This application is a simple Android drawing app. This was created as part of the Fall 2016 CMSC434 Human Computer Interaction course at the University of Maryland.

# What Does This Do?

This ImpressionistApp is a simple impressionistic drawing Android application. With this app, you can:
* Download pre-selected sample photos from the internet (or import your own from your gallery)
* Load an image to the app for drawing
* Touch your finger to the right-hand side of the screen to "recreate" the drawing on the left with a brush
* Change your brush style to a: Circle, Dynamic Circle, Square, Line, "CMSC434", or Custom Text Brush
* Save your impressionistic drawing to your phone
* Clear your drawing screen

# How to Install

To run this program, check out this project on your computer. You can then view (and edit) files locally.
The app is most easily run through a working copy of Android Studio using a physical phone or an emulator.
